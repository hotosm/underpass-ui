# Underpass UI components

You can run the components playground following these steps.

## Requirements

First, install and run the [Underpass REST API](https://github.com/hotosm/underpass/blob/master/docs/python-rest-api.md)

Then, for running the playground, you'll need:

* Node
* NPM
* Yarn

If you have problems installing Yarn, try with this approach:

```sh
npm install -g n
n stable
npm install --global yarn
```

## Run

```sh
cd js
yarn install
yarn cosmos
```

The default URL for the Underpass REST API is `http://localhost:8000`, but you can change it 
using an environment variable:

```sh
REACT_APP_UNDERPASS_API=http:://underpass.live:8000 yarn cosmos
```


## UnderpassMap component

This component shows a map updated with the latest changes made into OSM and the option to highlight certain aspects of data.

### Basic view

```js
<UnderpassMap 
	center={[-0.74293, -90.31972]}
/>
```

It will show a map with all buildings highlighted, as “building” is the default tag key.

If you want to highlight other feature, like “natural”, just pass the “tag” property:

```js
<UnderpassMap 
	center={[-0.74293, -90.31972]}
    tagKey="building"
    tagValue="yes"
/>
```

### Data Quality

Use the property “highlightDataQualityIssues” to highlight features suspicious of having some issue with quality.

```js
<UnderpassMap 
	center={[-0.74293, -90.31972]}
	highlightDataQualityIssues
/>
```
